Oh yeah, yeah
Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, and just said this
"I know exactly what I want this year
Santa, can you hear me?"
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
You'll be all my own in a big red bow
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong, for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're comin' to town
Santa, can you hear me?
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh please, make my wish come true
Santa, can you hear me?
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
We'll be all alone under the mistletoe
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
I hope my letter reaches you in time, oh yeah
Bring me a love, I can call all mine, oh yeah
'Cause I have been so good, so good this year
Can't be alone, under the mistletoe
He's all I want and a big red bow
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Oh Santa, can you hear me? Oh Santa
Well, he's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Santa, that's my only wish this year
